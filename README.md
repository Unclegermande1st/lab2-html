In this project, I created a structured HTML5 webpage.
 Firstly, I set up a project folder and created files like index.html and README.md. 
 I then built the webpage using semantic HTML5 elements like  <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside> and <footer>. 
 A navigation menu, content area, sidebar and footer were included .
 I also added a contact form with HTML5 validation to ensure that users provide a valid name, email and message. 
 After validating the HTML with the W3C Validator and correcting the errors, 
 I pushed the project on GitHub by initializing a Git repository, committing the files and pushing the code to GitHub.
Finally, I collaborated with my partner by adding my details in thier file and submitting a pull request to their repository. of which likewise my partner also did to my repository
